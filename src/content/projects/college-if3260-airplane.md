## Overview

A 3D airplane model rendered in the browser using raw **WebGL** — no Three.js or other libraries. Built as the final project for **IF3260 Grafika Komputer** (Computer Graphics) at ITB, the assignment demonstrates understanding of the graphics pipeline from first principles.

## Features

- 3D airplane geometry modeled with vertices and faces
- Custom vertex and fragment shaders (GLSL)
- Transformations: translation, rotation, scaling
- Interactive camera controls
- Lighting and shading

## Tech Stack

- **WebGL** — low-level GPU rendering API
- **GLSL** — vertex and fragment shaders
- **JavaScript** — application logic and matrix math
- **HTML Canvas** — rendering target
