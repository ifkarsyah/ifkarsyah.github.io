## Overview

**Data Engineering Garden** is a personal knowledge base covering data engineering concepts, tools, and patterns — published as a browsable digital garden. It's built on [Quartz v4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a static site generator designed for Obsidian-style markdown notes with bidirectional links and a graph view.

The garden covers topics like streaming architectures, batch processing, data lakehouse design, orchestration, and specific tools (Kafka, Flink, dbt, Airflow, Spark, etc.).

## Why a Digital Garden?

Unlike a blog with polished posts, a digital garden grows incrementally — notes start rough and get refined over time. Pages link to each other freely, forming a knowledge graph rather than a linear timeline.

## Tech Stack

- **Quartz v4** — static site generation from markdown
- **TypeScript** — Quartz configuration and customization
- **Obsidian** — local note editing
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting
